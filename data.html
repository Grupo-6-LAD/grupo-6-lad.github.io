                                        In this dataset that was created through the extraction of data from our XML specification on XPATH, we queried our document to give us the exact number of known Galaxies, from our Local Group, that were discovered up until 1950 and after that same year. With the results obtained we were able to draw a comparison that further proves how impactful the "boom" in space exploration really was and how it affected the study of Galaxies.
